                "XDG Technologies LLC (XDG) has developed a proprietary, compact, hand-held medical device used to clamp and compress tissue during various surgical procedures. In conjunction with an excision device, the clamp can be utilized during procedures such as skin tag removal and Type B polydactyly.", 
                "The XDG device is intended to impact the current standard of care in these types of surgical procedures which include surgical ligation and/or burning, cutting or freezing of the tissue subsequent to clamping. This impact is expected to be beneficial to the patient and the caretaker.",

                  "XDG Technologies has developed a proprietary, compact, handheld medical device for the treatment of Postaxial Polydactyly Type B in newborns with extra fingers and toes, and the removal of skin tags for people of all ages.",
                  "Postaxial Polydactyly Type B is a congenital malformation that causes a person to be born with extra fingers and toes that do not contain bone or ligaments. Skin tags are small outgrowths of skin that affect men and women of all ages, with increased incidence rates among obese, diabetic, and geriatric populations.",
                  "Current Standards of Care: The current standard of care treatment for polydactyly is suture ligation where a thin thread is tightly tied to the base of the extra digit, restricting blood flow and causing the tissue to subsequently blacken, die and fall off over a period of seven to 10 days. At times, the extra digit may need to be surgically removed, requiring a surgical referral and general anesthesia for a newborn. Complications of the current standard treatment include: arterial bleeding, infection of the surgical site, and blackened digits that do not fall off after 10 days. Following even successful suture ligation procedures, people may experience pain, discomfort, and tingling, as well as intermittent bleeding, or ulceration, for many years after the treatment, or for their entire life.",
                  "Skin tags often occur in the neck, armpit and groin areas, causing both cosmetic and functional concerns. The current standard of care to remove skin tags is burning, cutting, or freezing the skin outgrowth, which may cause pain, bleeding, blistering, scarring, and pigmentation changes. In addition to uncomfortable results, these standard treatments may require multiple visits to resolve or completely remove the skin tag.",
                  "The XDG Technologies Solution: An innovative solution from XDG Technologies will greatly improve the standard of care for polydactyly and skin tags. The device is a clamp that removes extra digits and skin tags through a procedure that takes approximately 10 minutes instead of 10 days. The process is less painful and has a shorter recovery time, making it more comfortable, as well as more time and cost effective for patients and care takers.",
                  "In the future, additional applications for the XDG clamp may include the treatment of moles, warts, hemorrhoids and scar tissue.",
                  "XDG holds the intellectual property along with the University of Florida, including patents and patents pending, for the device.",

        {id: 1, question: 'What causes skin tags and how can the clamp help?', answer : 'The clamp procedure is the more comfortable, less costly, and more desirable option for these patients.The patients who undergo removal of the achrocordons, will subsequently be followed after the removal at 2-3 months to determine if any recurrence, scarring, or discoloration of the skin has occurred. At that time, the patients will be asked to answer a simple voluntary survey of satisfaction to determine their opinion of the method used. Pictures of the skin tags before and after its removal will be obtained, in order to demonstrate the resolution of the lesion, or to document any secondary finding that may have taken place. '},
        {id: 2, question: 'Why is the clamp a safer option?', answer : 'The procedure to use the XDG Clamp does not require sutures, does not result in “stitches” or bleeding. It is a suture free procedure. Current uses of suture ligature in infants with the “Polydactyly Type B” (extra fingers/toes) condition results in multiple problems. The problems include pain, increased likelihood of infection and most importantly the current standard of care (SOC) involving suture ligature takes approximately 10 days, the XDG Clamp and related procedure takes 10 MINUTES, instead of days. The current SOC is considered an almost “medieval” and also sometimes called barbaric for infants born with extra fingers of toes who suffer from this condition. Removal by of extra digits in Polydactyly by using scalpel excision is not recommended due to the risk for hemorrhage, the high likelihood that sutures (stitches) will be required to prevent post removal bleeding and subsequently need to be removed, these pitfalls are also associated with skin tag removal using the same procedure.'},
        {id: 3, question: 'What is polydactyly?', answer : 'Polydactyly is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the hand and feet. It manifests in humans and animals as one or more extra fingers or toes. The extra digit is usually a small piece of soft tissue; it may either contain bone without any joints or be a complete functioning unit. The majority of polydactyly cases are inherited, manifesting as a dominant or recurrent trait, so the number of cases are expected to rise worldwide. The condition can occur in one limb or, in rare cases, can be present in all 4 limbs'},
