                "XDG Technologies LLC (XDG) has developed a proprietary, compact, hand-held medical device used to clamp and compress tissue during various surgical procedures. In conjunction with an excision device, the clamp can be utilized during procedures such as skin tag removal and Type B polydactyly.", 
                "The XDG device is intended to impact the current standard of care in these types of surgical procedures which include surgical ligation and/or burning, cutting or freezing of the tissue subsequent to clamping. This impact is expected to be beneficial to the patient and the caretaker.",

                  "XDG Technologies has developed a proprietary, compact, handheld medical device for the treatment of Postaxial Polydactyly Type B in newborns with extra fingers and toes, and the removal of skin tags for people of all ages.",
                  "Postaxial Polydactyly Type B is a congenital malformation that causes a person to be born with extra fingers and toes that do not contain bone or ligaments. Skin tags are small outgrowths of skin that affect men and women of all ages, with increased incidence rates among obese, diabetic, and geriatric populations.",
                  "Current Standards of Care: The current standard of care treatment for polydactyly is suture ligation where a thin thread is tightly tied to the base of the extra digit, restricting blood flow and causing the tissue to subsequently blacken, die and fall off over a period of seven to 10 days. At times, the extra digit may need to be surgically removed, requiring a surgical referral and general anesthesia for a newborn. Complications of the current standard treatment include: arterial bleeding, infection of the surgical site, and blackened digits that do not fall off after 10 days. Following even successful suture ligation procedures, people may experience pain, discomfort, and tingling, as well as intermittent bleeding, or ulceration, for many years after the treatment, or for their entire life.",
                  "Skin tags often occur in the neck, armpit and groin areas, causing both cosmetic and functional concerns. The current standard of care to remove skin tags is burning, cutting, or freezing the skin outgrowth, which may cause pain, bleeding, blistering, scarring, and pigmentation changes. In addition to uncomfortable results, these standard treatments may require multiple visits to resolve or completely remove the skin tag.",
                  "The XDG Technologies Solution: An innovative solution from XDG Technologies will greatly improve the standard of care for polydactyly and skin tags. The device is a clamp that removes extra digits and skin tags through a procedure that takes approximately 10 minutes instead of 10 days. The process is less painful and has a shorter recovery time, making it more comfortable, as well as more time and cost effective for patients and care takers.",
                  "In the future, additional applications for the XDG clamp may include the treatment of moles, warts, hemorrhoids and scar tissue.",
                  "XDG holds the intellectual property along with the University of Florida, including patents and patents pending, for the device.",

        {id: 1, question: 'Key Updates', answer : '1) In July, 2016, we submitted the matching funds for our $60,948.00 U.F. Contracts and Grants award. XDG funded $30,474.00 and U.F. correspondingly funds/matches an additional $30,474.00 towards costs of independently validating the Digi-Clamp®. We expect to begin the actual trials and document our testing results by Fall/Winter, 2016. 2) We continue to file the required XDG Patent registrations for both our Domestic and International protection. The international “PCT” (Patent Cooperation Treaty) filings have been submitted and continue to be filed & registered with the assistance of XDG’s Patent Attorney (David Saliwanchik, Esq). The countries where we have filed the PCT include: Canada, China, Europe (EPO- European Patent Office comprised of several countries), Japan and of course, the United States. 3) We also on July 11, 2106, agreed to pay for the renewal of the patent application which will become due in October 23, 2016. We will have to submit payment by September 9, 2016, and expect to provide our payment in the month of August of this year. This renewal is due for our Canada and EPO (Europe) patent applications. As other renewals become due, we plan to also pay and renew those legal renewal fees. Those fees will have to be paid by XDG, and we will continue to confirm this commitment with our legal patent attorney. 4) A draft of the I.R.B (Institutional Review Board) report/summary has been completed by Dr. Roig along with Carlos Hondal’s “non-medical” assistance for documentation of our process in our validation of the polydactyly removal procedure with the use of the Digi-Clamp® . A similar “IRB” will be drafted and subsequently reviewed by U.F. IRB review board for the Digi-Clamp® procedure in removing skin tags. Once the two IRB summaries are completed, we expect them to be published and shared in both the academic and medical communities. XDG will share the final IRBs with all our shareholders, stakeholders and friends at that particular occasion! 5) Our engineering firm assisting with our Prototype development, Medical Tool and Technology (MT & T), continues to work closely with XDG. We have built approximately 100 to 150 quality disposable Digi-Clamps® to use in our Validation trials (see item #1. Above). We have continued to successfully use the disposable Digi-Clamp® in “compassionate care” situations with documented waivers from all patients without any set-backs. We continue to be very excited regarding our future and look optimistically towards the completion of our validation trials this year! 6) We noted in our previous Winter 2015 update, the other products being considered by XDG. We will continue to review in the next few quarters or year, the retail version (disposable “take home skin tag kit”) and veterinary (bloodless castration device) versions of the prototypes. They are still under development and will require longer development times. 7) We continue to negotiate and meet with a firm out of Jacksonville in assisting us in steps to better commercialize and take our product(s) to market. We believe that we will have definite success in the test validation for empirical data (see item # 1 and # 5 above). This validation is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will contribute to the continued positive valuation of our company. 8) Dr. Roig, who had an unfortunate accident in the first quarter of this year, has recovered well and we all feel that we are back on track with our goals and aspirations. Selected Milestones with our UF (University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc.) License agreement have had to be revised and we have submitted the revised Milestones to UF for their review. We expect to hear back from them by the end of the fourth quarter of this year (Dec. 2016). 9) Thank you for your continued faith and support of XDG in this venture. Please make sure to have a great summer and excellent fall. We expect to provide you with another “update” by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Our best and warmest wishes from Dr. Roig and Carlos Hondal to you and your families.'},
